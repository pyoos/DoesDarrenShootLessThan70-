Quick ReadMe for KingKulk

A) List of files and information on them
  1. Quickstart.py:
    - This file is kinda useless, I might just remove it in the future
    - but basically it was the start of calling google drive API so that
    -  we could upload/download files from the google drive directly onto our computer.
  2. Googledrive.py:
    - This file is the main result from the Quickstart.py file above
    - basically you can use it to access the files in the DDS70 google drive and 
    - you should be able to download and upload files, it is conviently made
  3. kaggle1.py:
    - This is just a recreation of this kaggle link:
    - https://www.kaggle.com/code/stpeteishii/nba-tracking-by-yolov8#NBA-Tracking-by-YOLOv8
    - Only got through the first part but basically the code so far allows you to embed a video
    - It'll run the model and anntotate the input video and then can convert that original file from mp4 -> GIF
  4. sandbox.py
    - This file is what sam started working on initially to try and start training models via datasets from Roboflow
    - I think initial step here was to make sure object recognition was capable and then extract data in the form
    - of stats or something (you can check gdrive word docs for more info)
